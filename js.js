// --------------------------------------------
// JS TEST FINAL
// --------------------------------------------

// 1) Start by linking this js file to your index.html file.  What is the correct
//    place to insert most JS files?



// 2) Declare 5 variables each with a different variable type as it's value.



// 3) Next we will write conditional statements. Write:
//    a) an if else statement that checks your boolean variable and console logs 
//       your string variable if true and otherwise console logs false
//    b) a ternary statement ( ? : ) to check if your number variable is greater 
//       than 5. Console log true if it is and false if it isn't.
//    c) a conditional of your choice that finds out if your 'string' 
//       variable is of type string and your 'number' variable is a number. If both are 
//       true console.log('all types are correct')



// 4) Write a function that accepts 3 parameters: 2 number and a name.  The function
//    should add both numbers and return a string of "{NAME}'s number is {NUMBER}".


// 5) Invoke the function and save it's result in a variable, then console log the
//    variable.


// 6) Are all functions hoisted?


// 7) In the html file there is an h1 element.  Save the node in a variable and then 
//    set its text to "{YOUR_NAME}'s exam"


// 8) Use JS to set the id of the h1 to "heading-main"


// 9) Create a node list that selects every p in our HTML file. Then use the forEach
//    method to remove the class 'p-empty' and add text that say 'content here'


// 10) Write a function that first, randomly generates a number between 1 & 100 and
//     saves it in a variable called r.  Second, find the area of a circle with radius r. 
//     Third, round the result to 2 decimal spaces and console log the result. 


// 11) Use addEventListener to listen for a click and turns the event's target's
//     text into a different color. 


// 12) Create a for loop that console logs all the even numbers up to 22 not 
//     including 0. Write the same loop using do...while 


// 13) Create an array with at least 4 values in it (use both at least 1 string
//     and 1 number).  Then push another value into the array.  


// 14) Replace the 2nd index position value with 44.


// 15) Filter the array to only contain numbers.


// 16) Create an object that describes something you like and contains a string,
//     a number, an array and an object value inside it.  Lastly, create a method attached
//     to the object.


// 17) Create 2 input fields where the user can search for a song and an artist. Then
//     add a button.  When the button is clicked, an API fetch call should be made (use 
//     https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/artist/title to achieve this. You can read more of
//     the documentation at https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search).

//     Lastly, make a function that renders a div containing: 
//          -an h2 with the song name
//          -a h3 with artist name
//          -a p with the lyrics of the song the user searched for


// 18) Rename your root folder to '{YOUR_NAME} js-test'.  Compress it into a zip file and send it to me and you're done :)
